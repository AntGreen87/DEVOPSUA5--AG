# Step 1: Strategy Comparison (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling)

In CI/CD workflows, how we deploy changes can have just as much impact as the code itself. One bad rollout can break production, hurt user trust, and waste hours or even days of recovery time. That’s why choosing the right deployment strategy—Blue/Green, Canary, or Rolling—is a key part of being a thoughtful DevOps engineer.

Each strategy offers a different balance of risk, speed, infrastructure requirements, and rollback options. Here’s my breakdown of each one, based on what I learned in the lecture—and where I’d use them.

## Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green is like having a safety net in production. You maintain two identical environments—Blue is live, Green is idle. You deploy new changes to Green, test them, and when everything looks good, you switch all incoming traffic to it. The best part is that if something goes wrong, you can immediately roll back by pointing traffic back to Blue.

It’s simple, safe, and perfect for high-stakes systems where downtime is not an option.

Ideal for: Financial services, healthcare platforms, or authentication systems—anywhere rollback needs to be instant and downtime is unacceptable.

Tradeoff: You need double the infrastructure—two environments running side-by-side.

## Canary Deployment

Canary deployment is like testing your update in the real world, but with a smaller blast radius. You slowly release changes to a small percentage of users (like 5–10%), monitor how things go, and if everything checks out, you ramp up to 100 percent. If there’s a problem, you pause or roll back before it spreads.

This method gives you a tight feedback loop from real users and real systems—without risking everyone at once.

Ideal for: Apps with large user bases or frequent feature releases—like e-commerce stores, social media apps, or streaming platforms.

Tradeoff: It requires robust monitoring, clear rollout thresholds, and automated rollback logic to be effective.

## Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment is about gradual change. Instead of deploying to all servers at once, you update them in batches. One set goes down, gets updated, tested, then traffic flows to it while the next batch is handled. This strategy minimizes risk and downtime without requiring two environments.

It’s smooth, predictable, and ideal for large-scale infrastructure.

Ideal for: Microservices, container-based systems, or large server clusters that prioritize stability.

Tradeoff: Rollbacks aren’t as easy—you have to roll forward or redeploy a previous version manually to each subset.

## Comparison Table

Each strategy reflects a different approach to managing risk, speed, and complexity in DevOps:

| Strategy       | Downtime | Rollback | Infra Cost | Monitoring Needs |
|----------------|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Blue/Green     | None     | Instant  | High       | Low              |
| Canary         | Minimal  | Fast     | Medium     | High             |
| Rolling        | Minimal  | Manual   | Low        | Medium           |

## Final Thoughts

These strategies aren’t just technical choices—they reflect mindset. Blue/Green values safety and control. Canary values learning through real-world data. Rolling values steady, reliable progress. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer; the best engineers know how to match the strategy to the risk, the audience, and the infrastructure.

If I were leading a team, I’d want us to choose based on the impact of failure, the need for speed, and how much control we have over our environments. That’s the real job of DevOps—not just deploying, but deploying with intention.
