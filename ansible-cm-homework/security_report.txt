# Security Considerations in Configuration Management

## How it Improves Security
- Ensures consistent configuration across all environments
- Automates the application of security patches
- Reduces human error through repeatable playbooks

## How it Can Compromise Security
- Storing secrets in plain text (e.g., in Git)
- Misusing "become: yes" can lead to privilege escalation
- Not validating inventory sources (e.g., dynamic scripts)

## Best Practices
- Always use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive variables
- Never commit vault passwords or plain-text secrets to Git
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage playbook execution
- Audit and version-control your Ansible roles and inventories
