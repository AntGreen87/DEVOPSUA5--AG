## Why Artifact Management Matters in CI/CD

Artifact management is a key part of modern software delivery. In CI/CD pipelines, we’re building and shipping software constantly — often many times per day. That means we need a reliable way to store and version everything we build: Docker images, compiled files, binaries, and more.

Instead of rebuilding the app every time from scratch (which can introduce inconsistencies), we capture “artifacts” — the output of a successful build — and store them in a centralized place. Think of it like keeping clean, finished Lego sets so we don’t have to rebuild them from random blocks every time.

With proper artifact management:
- We avoid breaking things between builds.
- We keep history of what was built and deployed.
- We ensure what’s tested is exactly what gets shipped.

It saves time, reduces bugs, and makes rollbacks and deployments much smoother. And when combined with tools like Docker and container registries, it ensures that our builds are portable, traceable, and repeatable from dev all the way to production.

In short: Artifact management is how we treat our builds like real deliverables — not just temporary work.
