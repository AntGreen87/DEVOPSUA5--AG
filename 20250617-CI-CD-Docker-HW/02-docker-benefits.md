## How Docker Improves the CI/CD Pipeline

Docker brings consistency, speed, and simplicity to the CI/CD pipeline.

In traditional setups, apps might run fine on a developer's machine but break in staging or production. Docker solves this by wrapping everything — the app, dependencies, and runtime — into one container. That means no more “it worked on my laptop” problems.

In CI/CD pipelines, Docker helps by:
- Giving us identical environments from build to deploy.
- Making builds reproducible and isolated.
- Speeding up testing by running in containers instead of VMs.
- Allowing parallel jobs with zero interference.
- Simplifying deployment — we just ship the container image.

It also integrates well with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and cloud platforms. We can build once, test automatically, and push the exact same image to production. That’s a big deal for stability and developer confidence.

In short, Docker is the glue that makes modern CI/CD fast, predictable, and portable.
