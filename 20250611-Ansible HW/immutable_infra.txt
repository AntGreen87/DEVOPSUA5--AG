Immutable infrastructure means servers or systems are never modified after they are deployed. 
If something needs to change, a new version is created and deployed from scratch.

This approach prevents configuration drift, increases consistency, and makes rollbacks easier.

The challenge is that it requires automation and good tooling to rebuild and redeploy often.

Tools like Docker help by packaging everything into containers that donâ€™t change after creation. 
Kubernetes then manages those containers and replaces them automatically if needed.
