1. Disable fact gathering when it's not needed:
   Use "gather_facts: false" at the top of your playbooks to speed up execution.

2. Use loops instead of repetitive tasks:
   Combine similar tasks using "with_items" or loop syntax to avoid duplication.

3. Tag your tasks:
   Run only the necessary parts of a playbook by using "--tags" to reduce execution time.
